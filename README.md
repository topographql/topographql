## TopoGraphQL
**TopoGraphQL** is an open-source GraphQL IDE, schema visualizer, and endpoint analytics tool. Inspired by GraphiQL, **TopoGraphQL** provides developers a streamlined, in-browser solution for navigating and testing complex GraphQL APIs and queries.

Visit [topographql.com](http://topographql.com) to get started!

## Features
- ðŸ”Ž Enhance the design of your data models and API by exploring your schema as a graph
- ðŸš¥ Test and reduce inefficiencies in your GraphQL queries by visualizing the query response path
- ðŸš€ Visualize resolver-level performance data with support for [Apollo Tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)
- ðŸ“š Register to save queries for easy comparison and access to query history
- ðŸ‘€ More to come!

## Usage
- Enter your GraphQL endpoint
- Submit your queries and view the query response
- If your GraphQL server has [Apollo Tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing) enabled, **TopoGraphQL** will highlight the query response path and display resolver-level response times
- Login or register to save your queries and view your query history
----
- If you don't have a GraphQL server set up, public GraphQL endpoints can be visualized and queried too
  E.g. https://github.com/lucasbento/graphql-pokemon
